All scripts are written in Python 3.6, using only built-in functions, constants, types, and exceptions. The sole exception to this rule is the use of the `hashlib` library for day 4, where the [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) functions in the library were deemed necessary. Where applicable, the input data file is placed in the same directory as the Python script.
